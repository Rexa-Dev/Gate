# Submitting a Pull Request
If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer opening one for discussion before working on a PR. You can work on any issue that doesn't have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned to it. These show up in the sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on an issue that interests you.

Before you create a PR, make sure to run tests using the `make test` command to prevent any bugs.
